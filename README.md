# Temperature Conversion App

This Flutter app allows users to easily convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius. The user can select either Fahrenheit-to-Celsius or Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversions, input a temperature value, and view the converted result. The app also keeps a conversion history that can be cleared at any time. The app is designed to work seamlessly in both portrait and landscape orientations.

## Features

- **Temperature Input**: Users can enter a temperature value to convert.
- **Conversion Selection**: Users can select one of two options:
  - Fahrenheit to Celsius
  - Celsius to Fahrenheit
- **Conversion Display**: After pressing the "Convert" button, the converted temperature value is displayed, rounded to 2 decimal places.
- **History Log**: The app keeps a record of all conversions, showing the input value and the converted result.
- **Clear History**: Users can clear the conversion history at any time.
- **Responsive Layout**: The app adjusts automatically to both portrait and landscape orientations.

## Formulae

The following formulae are used for conversions:

- **Fahrenheit to Celsius**: 
  \[
  째C = (째F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9}
  \]
- **Celsius to Fahrenheit**: 
  \[
  째F = 째C \times \frac{9}{5} + 32
  \]
